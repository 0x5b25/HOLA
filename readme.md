HOLA: Header Only (barely sufficient) Algebra Library

Aiming at ease of use, a few algorithms are integrated:
 * Matrix column pivot QR decomp
 * Matrix gaussian elimination
 * Least square solution
 * Simplex method for linear programming

The `ndarray` class is a multidimentional array class inspired by the python `numpy` module.

SIMD may come later :(
